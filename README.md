Chat bot : 
===================
A chatbot is either powered by per-programmed responses or artificial intelligence to answer a user’s questions without the need of a human operator.

What is RASA?
RASA comes up with 2 components —

i.  RASA NLU: RASA NLU (Natural Language Understanding) is an open-source natural language processing tool for intent (describes what type of messages) classification and
    entity (what specifically a user is asking about) extraction in chatbots.
ii. RASA Core: RASA Core is a dialogue engine for building AI assistants. It’s part of the open source RASA framework. Rather than a bunch of if/else statements, 
    it uses a machine learning model trained on example conversations (the structured input from the NLU)to decide what to do next (next best action using a probabilistic model like LSTM neural network).
